# Known Issues

- Limited error messages from CrUX API sometimes make debugging difficult

- Bulk processing of many URLs (>20) can be slow due to API rate limits

- Some edge cases in URL formatting not fully handled

# Next Steps

- Implement user authentication for saved reports

- Add historical data tracking

- Enhance recommendations engine with more sophisticated analysis

- Implement CSV export functionality

- Add more visualization options (charts, graphs)

# Insights and Recommendations Implementation

The application provides basic performance insights based on CrUX metrics:

- Identifies poor-performing URLs (LCP > 4s, CLS > 0.25, etc.)

- Suggests common optimizations (image compression, preloading, etc.)

- Highlights opportunities for improvement based on metric distributions
